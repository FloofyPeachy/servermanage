# servermanage
A program that is pretty much a Minecraft manager. Created in VB and WPF because....

Things right now: Got the main UI working, going to disable the menu screen, turn it on yourself if you have VS installed and you can edit the .xaml
file. 

Also press ALT + D to show a popup that you can send stuff to the textbox. Useful for testing things like the user joined stuff.

Note, this is not finshed. Don't expect everything to work. Well, expect some things to work, but not anything. Note that there is no
option to make a server, so I set up a test one for you. Enjoy it. 


Wew.
